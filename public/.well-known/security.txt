# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our application,
please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to security@frozenshield.ca

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not,
please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information (as much as you can provide):
* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

* Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data,
  and interruption or degradation of our services
* Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the
  account holder
